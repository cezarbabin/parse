L/R 001. (CIS 140, LING105, PHIL044, PPE 140, PSYC207) Introduction to Cognitive Science.
(A) Brainard/Ungar. This is a Formal Reasoning course.
Cognitive Science is founded on the realization that many problems in the analysis of human and
artificial intelligence require an Interdisciplinary approach. The course is intended to introduce
undergraduates from many areas to the problems and characteristic concepts of Cognitive Science,
drawing on formal and empirical approaches from the parent disciplines of computer science,
Linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy and psychology. The topics covered include Perception,
Action, Learning, Language, Knowledge Representation, and Inference, and the relations and
interactions between them.
The course shows how the different views from the parent disciplines interact and identifies some
common themes among the theories that have been proposed. The course pays particular attention
to the distinctive role of computation in such theories and provides an introduction to some of the
main directions of current research in the field. It is a requirement for the BA in Cognitive Science,
the BAS in Computer and Cognitive Science, and the minor in Cognitive Science, and it is
recommended for students taking the dual degree in Computer and Cognitive Science.

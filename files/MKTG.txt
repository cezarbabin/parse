266. Marketing for Social Impact. (A) Deborah Small.Prerequisite(s): MKTG 101 or instructor
permission. Students may not take both MKTG 266 and MKTG 233 (the 0.5 cu version of the course)
for credit.
Private and public sector firms increasingly use marketing strategies to engage their customers and
stakeholders around social impact. To do so, managers need to understand how best to engage and
influence customers to behave in ways that have positive social effects. This course focuses on the
strategies for changing the behavior of a target segment of consumers on key issues in the public
interest (e.g., health behaviors, energy efficiency, poverty reduction, fundraising for social causes).
How managers partner with organizations (e.g., non-profits, government) to achieve social impact will
also be explored.
270. (MKTG770) Digital Marketing, Social Media and E-Commerce. (B) Berman, Bell.Prerequisite
(s): MKTG 101. Students may not take both MKTG 270 and the half semester version of this course,
MKTG 227 for credit. This course replaces experimental course MKTG 230x.
MKTG 270 explores the digital marketing environment from both a consumer and business
perspective. The course provides an overview of various online business models and delves into
digital advertising and social media marketing techniques and technologies. A mixture of case studies,
guest speakers and assignments, including one that uses real advertising data, translates theory into
practice. It is recommended that students enrolling in the course be comfortable using Excel and are
knowledgeable in applying regression analysis techniques. Students who would prefer a less technical
course may wish to take MKTG 227, Digital Marketing and Electronic Commerce, a half cu course
offered by the department.
271. (MKTG771) Models for Marketing Strategy. (M) Eliashberg.Prerequisite(s): MKTG 101, STAT
101 and some tolerance for expressing critical ideas in simple math.
In today's business environment, marketing executives are involved in complex decision-making and
they become responsible for return on their marketing investments. The first objective of this course is
to help participants become better executives. By exposing students to various analytical and
computer-based tools, developed for solving marketing problems, it will help to prepare them for
careers in industries such as consumer packaged goods, hi-tech, financial services, media and
entertainment, pharmaceutical, consulting, and venture capital.
The course's main focus is on various existing models, such as models that predict the consumer's
dynamic adoption of an innovative product. However, at some point in their career, students may find
themselves facing business problems for which a model can assist in making decisions, but no
existing model is available. Hence, the second objective of the course is to provide participants with
critical skills necessary to evaluate new models to which they may be exposed by attending
presentations or reading the literature. The models to be discussed in the class have been
implemented and proven useful in a wide range of industries (e.g., business-to-consumers and
business-to-business).
The course is not only about models, however. It also covers modeling needs. Some industries such
as the media and entertainment or the pharmaceutical industries present unique problems and
modeling needs. The third objective of the course is to expose participants to the nature and essence
of such idiosyncratic problems as well as modeling needs in such industries. Overall, the course will
make participants understand better critical marketing problems by analyzing them rigorously and will
enhance their skills in either designing or evaluating models-based strategies.

MKTG 288 and MKTG 254 (former MKTG 222) for credit.
This course is designed to equip students with the concepts, techniques, and latest thinking on pricing
issues, with an emphasis on ways in which to help a firm improve its pricing. The orientation of the
course is about practice of pricing, not theory. We will focus on how firms can improve profitability
through pricing, look at how firms set their prices and how to improve current practices to increase
profitability. The first part of the course focuses on how to analyze costs, customers, and competitors
in order to formulate proactive pricing strategies. The second part focuses on price promotions, price
bundling, price discrimination, versioning, nonlinear pricing, pricing through a distribution channel,
dynamic pricing, etc.
306. (MKTG806) Special Topics: Retail Merchandising. (A) Prerequisite(s): MKTG 101; MKTG 225.
0.5 c.u., One-half term (Former MKTG 396)
This course provides a detailed introduction to the role of merchandising at various retailers, including
apparel and other soft lines businesses, grocery stores, mass-merchandisers and "category killers".
Selected topics may include product development, line planning, sourcing, product lifecycle,
forecasting, planning and allocation, pricing and markdowns, and vendor relations.
350. Special Topics - Consumer Neuroscience. (B) Wes Hutchinson.Prerequisite(s): None.
Basic neuroscience made steady progress throughout the 20th century with only small areas of
application outside of medicine. Over the past 30 years, however, breakthroughs in measurement and
computation have accelerated basic research and created major applications for business and
technology. Currently, applications to marketing research and product development are experiencing
explosive growth that has been met with both excitement and skepticism. This mini-course provides an
overview of these developments. The course follows a straightforward theory/application format for
each major area of cognitive neuroscience. On Tuesdays, the basics of neuroscience are covered
along with a few illustrative applications. A key take-away from this part of the course is to gain the
elementary scientific knowledge that is necessary to separate "neuro-reality" from "neuro-hype." On
Thursdays, we cover application areas in greater detail. There are two general types of applications.
First, there are applications of neuroscience in marketing research. Topics will range from well-known
and widely used applications, such as eye-tracking measures in the lab and the field, to emerging
methods and measures, such as mobile EEG, face reading algorithms, and fMRI predictors of market
response.
Application areas include, packaging and shelf display, copy testing for telev ision and print
advertisements, video games, product usability studies, and simulators. Second, there are applications
of neuroscience in the development of new products. Product development applications include
wearableting physiological devices and apps, sensory branding for foods and fragrances,n
pharmaceuticals and medical devices (especially prosthetic devices), andng neuroscience-based
"edutainment" designed to enhance cognitive functions. Special attention will also be paid to changes
in brain anatomy and function over the lifespan. Key markets are children (mainly for enhancement
products), seniors (mainly for remediation/restoration products), and working adults (both
enhancement and remediation/restoration products). This course is self-contained and has no
prerequisites. That said, students with some background in business, industrial design, psychology, or
neuroscience are likely to find the material covered in this course complementary to the knowledge
they already have.

309. (MKTG809) Special Topics: Experiments for Business Decision Making. (B) Prerequisite(s):
MKTG 101 or faculty permission is required; STAT 101, STAT 431, or equivalent is recommended.
(Former MKTG 269)
In the past decade, massive shifts in how companies interact with their customers have suddenly
made field experiments an economically feasible way to learn about a variety of business questions
such as what types of promotions are most effective, what products should be stocked at a store, how
e-mail promotions should be designed, how sales staff should be compensated, etc. Many marketers
engaged in online retailing, direct-marketing, online advertising, media management, etc. are rapidly
embracing a "test and learn" philosophy and a number of platforms such as Google Website
Optimizer, have been developed to facilitate rigorous field experiments in the online environment. Just
as with the quality revolution in manufacturing during the 1980s and 1990s, the rapid rise of the "test
and learn" philosophy in marketing has created a huge demand for those who can design, field, and
analyze marketing experiments.
Through this course, you will learn and practice a wide range of critical skills, from the statistical
methods used to design and analyze experiments to the management and strategy required to
execute an experiment and act on the results. Although the cases and examples will focus on
marketing problems, the material covered can be applied in a number of other domains particularly
operations management and product design.
399. (MKTG899) Independent Study. (C) Prerequisite(s): MKTG 212 and written permission of
instructor and the department undergraduate advisor. Content arranged by project supervisor, 1.0 c.u
476. (MKTG776, STAT476) Applied Probability Models for Marketing. (C) Fader.Prerequisite(s): A
high comfort level with basic integral calculus and recent exposure to a formal course in probability
and statistics such as STAT 430 is strongly recommended.
This course will expose students to the theoretical and empirical "building blocks" that will allow them
to construct, estimate, and interpret powerful models of consumer behavior. Over the years,
researchers and practitioners have used these models for a wide variety of applications, such as new
product sales, forecasting, analyses of media usage, and targeted marketing programs. Other
disciplines have seen equally broad utilization of these techniques. The course will be entirely lecturebased with a strong emphasis on real-time problem solving. Most sessions will feature sophisticated
numerical investigations using Microsoft Excel. Much of the material is highly technical.
611. Marketing Management. (A) Williams, Kahn, Berger.Prerequisite(s): None. One half term. 0.5 cu
This course addresses how to design and implement the best combination of marketing efforts to
carry out a firm's strategy in its target markets. Specifically, this course seeks to develop the student's
(1) understanding of how the firm can benefit by creating and delivering value to its customers, and
stakeholders, and (2) skills in applying the analytical concepts and tools of marketing to such
decisions as segmentation and targeting, branding, pricing, distribution, and promotion. The course
uses lectures and case discussions, case write-ups, student presentations, and a comprehensive final
examination to achieve these objectives.
712. (MKTG212) Data and Analysis for Marketing Decisions. (C) Iyengar, Eliashberg.Prerequisite
(s): MKTG 611; STAT 613 strongly recommended. Format: Lecture, discussion, and cases.(Former
MKTG 756, Marketing Research)
Firms have access to detailed data of customers and past marketing actions. Such data may include
in-store and online customer transactions, customer surveys as well as prices and advertising. Using
real-world applications from various industries, the goal of the course is to familiarize students with
several types of managerial problems as well as data sources and techniques, commonly employed in
making effective marketing decisions. The course would involve formulating critical managerial
problems, developing relevant hypotheses, analyzing data and, most importantly, drawing inferences
and telling convincing narratives, with a view of yielding actionable results.

612. Dynamic Marketing Strategy. (C) Van den Bulte, Bradlow.Prerequisite(s): MKTG 611. One half
term. 0.5 cu
Building upon Marketing 611, the goal of this course is to develop skills in formulating and
implementing marketing strategies for brands and businesses. The course will focus on issues such as
the selection of which businesses and segments to compete in, how to allocate resources across
businesses, segments, and elements of the marketing mix, as well as other significant strategic issues
facing today's managers in a dynamic competitive environment.
A central theme of the course is that the answer to these strategic problems varies over time
depending on the stage of the product life cycle at which marketing decisions are being made. As
such, the PLC serves as the central organizing vehicle of the course. We will explore such issues as
how to design optimal strategies for the launch of new products and services that arise during the
introductory phase, how to maximize the acceleration of revenue during the growth phase, how to
sustain and extend profitability during the mature phase, and how to manage a business during the
inevitable decline phase.
613. Strategic Marketing Simulation. (B) Reibstein.Prerequisite(s): MKTG 611. 0.5 cu
Building upon Marketing 611, Marketing 613 is an intensive immersion course designed to develop
skills in formulating and implementing marketing strategies for brands and businesses. The central
activity will be participation in a realistic integrative product management simulation named SABRE. In
SABRE, students will form management teams that oversee all critical aspects of modern product
management: the design and marketing of new products, advertising budgeting and design, sales
force sizing and allocation, and production planning. As in the real world, teams will compete for
profitability, and the success that each team has in achieving this goal will be a major driver of the
class assessment.
The SABRE simulation is used to convey the two foci of learning in the course: the changing nature
of strategic problems and their optimal solutions as industries progress through the product life cycle,
and exposure to the latest analytic tools for solving these problems. Specifically, SABRE management
teams will receive training in both how to make optimal use of marketing research information to
reduce uncertainty in product design and positioning, as well as decision support models to guide
resource allocation.
711. (MKTG211) Consumer Behavior. (C) Reed.Prerequisite(s): Completion of MKTG 611. Format:
Lectures and discussion, case analyses, presentations.(Former MKTG 773)
Marketing begins and ends with the customer, from determining customers' needs and wants to
providing customer satisfaction and maintaining customer relationships. This course examines the
basic concepts and principles in customer behavior with the goal of understanding how these ideas
can be used in marketing decision making. The class will consist of a mix of lectures, discussions,
cases, assignments, project work and exams. Topics covered include customer psychological
processes (e.g., motivation, perception, attitudes, decision-making) and their impact on marketing
(e.g., segmentation, branding, customer satisfaction). The goal is to provide you with a set of
approaches and concepts to consider when faced with a decision involving understanding customer
responses to marketing actions.
721. (MKTG221) New Product Management. (C) Prerequisite(s): MKTG 611. Format: Lectures,
cases, simulations, class discussions, and guest speakers. (Former MKTG 753)
This course provides a total immersion in the new product development process - from sourcing ideas
and innovation, through new product sales forecasting. The focus is on collective learning, what works,
what doesn't, and why. While the primary focus is the new product development process within a
corporate structure, some coverage is given to key issues surrounding start-ups.

Private and public sector firms increasingly use marketing strategies to engage their customers and
stakeholders around social impact. To do so, managers need to understand how best to engage and
influence customers to behave in ways that have positive social effects. This course focuses on the
strategies for changing the behavior of a target segment of consumers on key issues in the public

775. Managing Customer Value. (B) Fader.Prerequisite(s): None. Format: Lecture and discussion
As the concept of CRM becomes common parlance for every marketing executive, it is useful to take a
step back to better understand the various different behaviors that underlie the development of
successful CRM systems. These "behaviors" include customer-level decisions, firm actions, and the
delicate but complex interplay between the two. Accordingly this course is comprised of four main
modules.
We start with the discussion of customer profitability - focusing on the concepts of "customer lifetime
value" and "customer equity". We will examine how to measure long-run customer profitability in both
business-to-customer and business-to-business environments, and the uses of these measures as
major components assessing overall firm valuation. Second, we move to the value that the firm
provides to its customers - better understanding the true nature of customer satisfaction and its nontrivial relationship with firm profitability. Third, we examine each of the three main components of the
firm's management of its customer base: customer acquisition, development, and retention - and the
complex resource allocation task that must be balanced across them. Finally, we conclude with a
discussion of various tactical and organizational aspects of customer relationship management.

771. (MKTG271) Models for Marketing Strategy. (M) Eliashberg.Prerequisite(s): Completion of:
MKTG 611; and MKTG 612, 613 or 622; basic calculus; exposure to basic statistical analysis, and
some tolerance for expressing critical ideas in simple math. Format: Evaluating marketing models;
practicing with computer-based models and software; discussing case studies that describe modeling
applications; group presentations of model-based marketing analysis and strategy.
In today's business environment, marketing executives are involved in complex decision-making and
they become responsible for return on their marketing investments. The first objective of this course is
to help participants become better executives. By exposing students to various analytical and
computer-based tools, developed for solving marketing problems, it will help to prepare them for
careers in industries such as consumer packaged goods, hi-tech, financial services, media and
entertainment, pharmaceutical, consulting, and venture capital. The course's main focus is on various
existing models, such as models that predict the consumer's dynamic adoption of an innovative
product. However, at some point in their career, students may find themselves facing business
problems for which a model can assist in making decisions, but no existing model is available. Hence,
the second objective of the course is to provide participants with critical skills necessary to evaluate
new models to which they may be exposed by attending presentations or reading the literature. The
models to be discussed in the class have been implemented and proven useful in a wide range of
industries (e.g., business-to-consumers and business-to-business).
The course is not only about models, however. It also covers modeling needs. Some industries such
as the media and entertainment or the pharmaceutical industries present unique problems and
modeling needs. The third objective of the course is to expose participants to the nature and essence
of such idiosyncratic problems as well as modeling needs in such industries. Overall, the course will
make participants understand better critical marketing problems by analyzing them rigorously and will
enhance their skills in either designing or evaluating models-based strategies.
776. (MKTG476, STAT476) Applied Probability Models in Marketing. (B) Fader.Prerequisite(s):
Students must have a high comfort level with basic integral calculus, and recent exposure to a formal
course in probability and statistics is strongly recommended. Format: Lecture, real-time problem
solving
This course will expose students to the theoretical and empirical "building blocks" that will allow them
to develop and implement powerful models of customer behavior. Over the years, researchers and
practitioners have used these methods for a wide variety of applications, such as new product sales
forecasting, analyses of media usage, customer valuation, and targeted marketing programs. These
same techniques are also very useful for other types of business (and non-business) problems. The
course will be entirely lecture-based with a strong emphasis on real-time problem solving. Most
sessions will feature sophisticated numerical investigations using Microsoft Excel. Much of the material
is highly technical.
777. (MKTG277) Marketing Strategy. (A) Wind.Prerequisite(s): Completion of MKTG 611; and MKTG
612 or 613 or 622. Format varies by instructor. Typically: case, lecture, group projects and class
discussion. See syllabus.
This course views marketing as both a general management responsibility and an orientation of an
organization that helps one to create, capture and sustain customer value. The focus is on the
business unit and its network of channels, customer relationships, and alliances. Specifically, the
course attempts to help develop knowledge and skills in the application of advanced marketing
frameworks, concepts, and methods for making strategic choices at the business level.

725. 0.5 cu half credit course. Format: Lecture, discussion. (Former MKTG 896)
This course provides a detailed introduction to the role of merchandising at various retailers, including
apparel and other soft lines businesses, grocery stores, mass-merchandisers and "category killers".
Selected topics may include product development, line planning, sourcing, product life cycle,
forecasting, planning and allocation, pricing and markdowns, and vendor relations.
809. (MKTG309) Special Topics: Experiments for Business Decision Making. (C) Prerequisite(s):
MKTG 611 required; STAT 431 or equivalent required; MKTG 712 recommended but not required.
(Former MKTG 669)
In the past decade, massive shifts in how companies interact with their customers have suddenly
made field experiments an economically feasible way to learn about a variety of business questions
such as what types of promotions are most effective, what products should be stocked at a store, how
e-mail promotions should be designed, how sales staff should be compensated, etc. Many marketers
engaged in online retailing, direct-marketing, online advertising, media management, etc. are rapidly
embracing a "test and learn" philosophy and a number of platforms such as Google Website
Optimizer, have been developed to facilitate rigorous field experiments in the online environment. Just
as with the quality revolution in manufacturing during the 1980s and 1990s, the rapid rise of the "test
and learn" philosophy in marketing has created a huge demand for those who can design, field, and
analyze marketing experiments.
Through this course, you will learn and practice a wide range of critical skills, from the statistical
methods used to design and analyze experiments to the management and strategy required to
execute an experiment and act on the results. Although the cases and examples will focus on
marketing problems, the material covered can be applied in a number of other domains particularly
operations management and product design.

850. Special Topics - Consumer Neuroscience. (B) Wes Hutchinson.Prerequisite(s): None. 0.5 CU
half credit course
Basic neuroscience made steady progress throughout the 20th century with only small areas of
application outside of medicine. Over the past 30 years, however, breakthroughs in measurement and
computation have accelerated basic research and created major applications for business and
technology. Currently, applications to marketing research and product development are experiencing
explosive growth that has been met with both excitement and skepticism. This mini-course provides an
overview of these developments. The course follows a straightforward theory/application format for
each major area of cognitive neuroscience. On Tuesdays, the basics of neuroscience are covered
along with a few illustrative applications. A key take-away from this part of the course is to gain the
elementary scientific knowledge that is necessary to separate "neuro-reality" from "neuro-hype." On
Thursdays, we cover application areas in greater detail. There are two general types of applications.
First, there are applications of neuroscience in marketing research. Topics will range from well-known
and widely used applications, such as eye-tracking measures in the lab and the field, to emerging
methods and measures, such as mobile EEG, face reading algorithms, and fMRI predictors of market
response.
Application areas include, packaging and shelf display, copy testing for telev ision and print
advertisements, video games, product usability studies, and simulators. Second, there are applications
of neuroscience in the development of new products. Product development applications include
wearableting physiological devices and apps, sensory branding for foods and fragrances,n
pharmaceuticals and medical devices (especially prosthetic devices), andng neuroscience-based
"edutainment" designed to enhance cognitive functions. Special attention will also be paid to changes
in brain anatomy and function over the lifespan. Key markets are children (mainly for enhancement
products), seniors (mainly for remediation/restoration products), and working adults (both
enhancement and remediation/restoration products). This course is self-contained and has no
prerequisites. That said, students with some background in business, industrial design, psychology, or
neuroscience are likely to find the material covered in this course complementary to the knowledge
they already have.
SM 890. (OIDD890) Advanced Study Project (ASP). (C) Prerequisite(s): For GCP Advanced Study
Projects: Acceptance to this course is by application only. Students must apply and be interviewed in
September for spring participation. Visit www.whartongcp.org. Individual group meetings with the
instructor.
The principal objectives of this course are to provide opportunities for undertaking an in-depth study of
a marketing problem and to develop the students' skills in evaluating research and designing
marketing strategies for a variety of management situations. Selected projects can touch on any
aspect of marketing as long as this entails the elements of problem structuring, data collection, data
analysis, and report preparation. The course entails a considerable amount of independent work.
(Strict library-type research is not appropriate) Class sessions are used to monitor progress on the
project and provide suggestions for the research design and data analysis. The last portion of the
course often includes an oral presentation by each group to the rest of the class and project sponsors.
Along with marketing, the projects integrate other elements of management such as finance,
production, research and development, and human resources.

SM 895. Advanced Study Project - Domestic Consulting Practicum. (B) Prerequisite(s):
Acceptance to this course is by application only. Students must apply and be interviewed in
September for spring participation. Visit www.whartongcp.org. Corequisite(s): Students will not be
permitted to enroll in this course if they are delaying a core, in particular FNCE 601 in fall and FNCE
602 in the spring. Course is open to all first and second year full time and executive MBA students.
Individual group meetings with the instructor
The Wharton Domestic Consulting Practicum (DCP) creates a forum in which students of business
can apply the concepts, methods and paradigms learned in the classroom with the resources of a
professional network to develop strategic, innovative, and operational plans for organizations
worldwide. By providing students with resources and guidance (as opposed to direction), the DCP
endeavors to create an academic, social and ethically- minded atmosphere which cultivates
experiential and dynamic learning, and which produces state-of-the-art results for clients. Students'
learning correlates with their commitment levels and the efforts put into the projects and team effort.
Many, if not all, dimensions of the experience are screened against the "reality experience" one would
encounter in consulting (and other professional) environments, with an appropriate safety net tailored
to each team to enhance success and the Wharton brand.
899. (MKTG399) Independent Study. (C) Prerequisite(s): MKTG 611; and MKTG 612, 613 or 622;
and the written permission of instructor and the department MBA faculty advisor.
A student contemplating an independent study project must first find a faculty member who agrees to
supervise and approve the student's written proposal as an independent study (MKTG 899). If a
student wishes the proposed work to be used to meet the ASP requirement, he/she should then
submit the approved proposal to the MBA adviser who will determine if it is an appropriate substitute.
Such substitutions will only be approved prior to the beginning of the semester.

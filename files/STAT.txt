930. (MATH546) Probability. (A) Steele.Prerequisite(s): STAT 430 or 510 or equivalent.
Measure theory and foundations of Probability theory. Zero-one Laws. Probability inequalities. Weak
and strong laws of large numbers. Central limit theorems and the use of characteristic functions.
Rates of convergence. Introduction to Martingales and random walk.
932. (BSTA653) Survival Models and Analysis Methods for Medical and Biological Data. (M)
Zhao.Prerequisite(s): STAT 551.
Parametric models, nonparametric methods for one-and two-sample problems, proportional hazards
model, inference based on ranks. Problems will be considered from clinical trials, toxicology and
tumorigenicity studies, and epidemiological studies.
933. Analysis of Categorical Data. (M) Rosenbaum.Prerequisite(s): STAT 541 and 551.
Likelihood equations for log-linear models, properties of maximum likelihood estimates, exact and
approximate conditional inference, computing algorithms, weighted least squares methods, and
conditional independence and log-linear models. Applied topics, including interpretation of log-linear
and logit model parameters, smoothing of tables, goodness-of-fit, and incomplete contingency tables.
940. Advanced Inference I. (M) Staff.Prerequisite(s): STAT 551.
The topics covered will change from year to year. Typical topics include sequential analysis,
nonparametric function estimation, robustness, bootstrapping and applications decision theory,
likelihood methods, and mixture models.
941. Advanced Inference II. (M) Staff.Prerequisite(s): STAT 940.
A continuation of STAT 940.
SM 950. Quantitative Consulting Seminar. (B) Waterman.Prerequisite(s): No prerequisites, but
please talk to the instructor to determine your fit with the course.
The Practicum offers the opportunity for small combined teams of PhD's and MBA to work on "real
life" quantitative consulting projects. These projects are drawn from both business and University
sources. The emphasis is on providing a relevant and comprehensible solution to the client's problem.
In-class brainstorming sessions, client presentations and written reports give students the
opportunity to test for the existence of an intersection between their quantitative and communication
skills.
SM 951. Statistical Practice II. (M) Staff.Prerequisite(s): STAT 540, 541, 550 and 551.
A continuation of STAT 950.

953. (STAT473) Bioinformatics. (B) Ewens.Prerequisite(s): Good background in probability and
statistics at the approximate level of STAT 430 and STAT 431. The material will follow the class
textbook, Ewens and Grant "Statistical Models in Bioinformatics", Springer, second edtion, 2005.
An introduction to the use of statistical methods in the increasingly important scientific areas of
genomics and bioinformatics. The topics to be covered will be decided in detail after the initial class
meeting, but will be taken from the following: - background probability theory of one and many
random variables and of events; background statistical inference theory, classical and Bayesian;
Poisson processes and Markov chain; the analysis of one and many DNA sequences, in particular
shotgun sequencing, pattern analysis and motifs; substitution matrices, general random walk theory,
advanced statistical inference, the theory of BLAST, hidden Markov models, microarray analysis,
evolutionary models.
955. Stochastic Calculus and Financial Applications. (A) Steele.Prerequisite(s): STAT 530 or
equivalent.
Selected topics in the theory of probability and stochastic processes.
956. Financial and Economic Time Series. (B) Steele.Prerequisite(s): A graduate course in
statistics or econometrics. Familiarity with linear algebra.
This graduate course introduces students to the time series methods and practices which are most
relevant to the analysis of financial and economic data. The course will address both theoretical and
empirical issues. Extensive use will be made of the S-Plus Statistical Language, but no previous
experience of S-Plus will be required. The course begins with a quick review of ARIMA models. Most
of the course is devoted to ARCH, GARCH, threshold, switching Markov, state space, and nonlinear
models.
SM 957. Seminar in Data Analysis. (M) Staff.Prerequisite(s): STAT 541, 551, 552, 925, or
equivalents; permission of instructor.
Survey of methods for the analysis of large unstructured data sets: detection of outliers, Winsorizing,
graphical techniques, robust estimators, multivariate problems.
961. Statistical Methodology. (A) Buja.Prerequisite(s): STAT 431 or 520 or equivalent; a solid
course in linear algebra and a programming language.
This is a course that prepares 1st year PhD students in statistics for a research career. This is not an
applied statistics course. Topics covered include: linear models and their high-dimensional geometry,
statistical inference illustrated with linear models, diagnostics for linear models, bootstrap and
permutation inference, principal component analysis, smoothing and cross-validation.
SM 991. Seminar in Advanced Application of Statistics. (C) Staff.
This seminar will be taken by doctoral candidates after the completion of most of their coursework.
Topics vary from year to year and are chosen from advance probability, statistical inference, robust
methods, and decision theory with principal emphasis on applications.
970. Mathematical Statistics. (A) Small.Prerequisite(s): STAT 431 or 520 or equivalent; comfort with
mathematical proofs (e.g., MATH 360).
Decision theory and statistical optimality criteria, sufficiency, point estimation and hypothesis testing
methods and theory.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
(EG) {TCOM}
601. Advanced Networking Modeling and Analysis. (M) Prerequisite(s): TCOM 501.
Traffic management and call admission: traffic characterization traffic shaping, admission control,
statistical multiplexing, effective bandwidth. Scheduling: fair queuing, rate-controlled service
disciplines. Buffer management: pushout, threshold, random early detection, sharing mechanisms
(complete partitioning, complete sharing, hybrids), coupling buffer management and scheduling.
Markov decision process and application in resource allocation (memory, badwidth allocation).
Switching: input queuing, output queuing, shared memory, combined input/output queuing. Maximum
throughout in input queued switches, emulating output queuing with input queuing via speedup.
Building larger switches: CIOS networks, banyan netowrks, etc. TCP modeling.

204. (LGST204, LGST804, REAL804) Real Estate Law. (C) Staff.
This course examines the fundamentals of real estate finance and development from a legal
perspective. The course serves as a foundation course for real estate majors and provides an
introduction to real estate for other students. It attempts to develop skills in using legal concepts in a
real estate transactional setting. The course will be of interest to students contemplating careers in
accounting, real estate development, real estate finance, city planning, or banking. The main topics
covered may include the following: land acquisition, finance; choice of entity; tax aspects; management
(leasing, environmental); disposition of real property (sale of mortgaged property, foreclosures,
wraparound mortgages, sale-leasebacks); and recent legal developments.
206. (BEPP206, BEPP772, REAL772, REAL972) Urban Public Policy & Private Economic
Development. (B) Gilles Duranton.
This course considers a range of local policies in cities and regions. Examples include: clusters and
other local development initiatives, large scale regional policies, employment zones and other targeted
policies. More traditional urban policies such as zoning and planning and constraints, transportation
pricing, and parking policies among many others will also be considered. Practical examples will be
extremely diverse and include the Silicon Valley and attempts to copy it, the Tennessee Valley
Authority, housing retrictions in developing countries such as Brazil, congestion pricing in London, etc.
Students will be expected to actively participate and make presentations. The course emphasizes the
importance of the economic context, the understanding of the underlying rationale for policies, and
how the private agents respond to public incentives. The main learning goals are the following: be able
to use simple empirical tools of economic evaluations, be able to articulate a critical analysis of
competing viewpoints and assessments, and be able to integrate various analytic steps into an overal
assessment of economic policies that relies on sound principles and is well argued.
208. (BEPP208, BEPP708, REAL708) Housing Markets. (B) GYOURKO.Prerequisite(s): Managerial
Economics (BEPP 250) or equivalent. Lecture with discussion required.
This course is designed for students interested in the economics and operations of housing markets. It
is primarily a U.S. focused course, but does include a limited amount of international material for
comparative purposes. The class is divided into four sections: (1) supply and demand for housing,
including the operations of homebuilders and rental landlords; (2) house prices, including cycles and
price dynamics; (3) international comparisons; and (4) public policy analysis applied to a current
housing markets-related issue. This course presumes knowledge of intermediate economics, as we
will apply that knowledge throughout the semester. For Wharton students, this means you must have
passed BEPP 250 (undergrads) or MGEC 611 and 612 for MBA's. Non-Wharton students should have
taken the equivalent course in the College.
209. (FNCE209, FNCE721, REAL721) Real Estate Investment: Analysis and Financing. (C)
Ferreira, Sinai, Wong, Handbury.Prerequisite(s): FNCE 100.
This course provides an introduction to real estate with a focus on investment and financing issues.
Project evaluation, financing strategies, investment decision making and real estate capital markets
are covered. No prior knowledge of the industry is required, but students are expected to rapidly
acquire a working knowledge of real estate markets. Classes are conducted in a standard lecture
format with discussion required. The course contains cases that help students evaluate the impact of
more complex financing and capital markets tools used in real estate. There are case studies and two
midterms, (depending on instructor).

As a truly non-U.S. focused course, we explore the world of cross-border real estate development, with
a focus on fast growing emerging market economies. Topics will emphasize the importance of strategy
and implementation in cross-border real estate investment and include: the rationale, opportunities
and risks of international real estate investing; the macro factors that influence the performance of real
estate markets across countries; market specific factors that impact RE investment performance
(property rights, taxes, transparency, planning procedures); the qualitative aspects of identifying and
achieving successful projects; and the growing market for international RE securities and strategies for
portfolio management. Classes will combine a lecture on specific aspects of global cross-border RE in
the first half of the class and international case presentations in the second half. Cases will be
presented by leading executives in charge of major international RE projects or funds. Cases have
been selected to cover different types of RE development-residential, office, retail, hospitality and
logistics- important emerging market countries/continents (East/South Asia, Latin America, SubSaharan Africa, the Middle East) and different development and investment strategies.

SM 900. Real Estate Proseminar. (C) Staff.
Real estate is a rapidly changing and evolving field. Traditional course offerings are not always able to
incorporate the most recent advances in the many areas that make up the field of real estate. In this
course, the participants - both faculty and students - research and present current topics and recent
advances in real estate. The content will vary depending on the participants' interests and areas of
expertise, but will typically cover urban economics, spatial issues, the economics of housing and
commercial real estate markets, and real estate finance and investment.
This course is intended to expand students' awareness of current topics in real estate and to
prepare them to conduct their own academic quality research. The proseminar is organized as a
series of lectures by faculty and students on topics of their own choosing. These lectures may involve
well-known areas of knowledge, research, and methodology, as well as subjects currently under study.
The main course requirements are preparing and presenting a series of lectures on a real estate topic
(subject to the organizing faculty member's approval) and writing a research proposal that describes a
workable project building upon or extending one of the topics covered in the course.

500. Beginning Hindi-Urdu, For Graduate Students ONLY. Staff.
Beginning in the fall semester of 2014 Beginning Hindi and Beginning Urdu will be merged into a
single course, Beginning Hindi-Urdu. At the beginning level spoken Urdu and Hindi are identical
except for a few minor points. The broad outline of the course will thus remain the same as that of the
current Beginning Hindi and Urdu courses. Students will learn to communicate with the language in a
variety of everyday culturally authentic situations. Additional Urdu and Hindi culture will be integrated
through authentic materials such as Bollywood film and music clips, and simple written texts. There
will be equal emphasis on both scripts and cultures, and parallel written materials will be provided in
both scripts. Students will be expected to develop first-year proficiency in one script of their choice,
and will be encouraged to learn both. By merging the two courses students will be exposed to a
broader range of linguistic and cultural styles, and students will thus have the opportunity to develop a
deeper understanding that more closely resembles that of Hindi and Urdu native speakers. Please

vocabulary development and on using contextually appropriate styles of spoken and written Hindi.

Advanced Hindi aims at systematically developing higher level linguistic functions and cultural
nuances. Students learn to describe, narrate and support opinions in informal and formal styles. The
objective of the course is to promote a meaningful interaction with written literature and with native
speakers in a socially acceptable manner in a variety of simple and complicated situations. A variety
of authentic materials are used, such as short stories, plays, newspapers, magazines, videos,
television and radio broadcasts, and interviews. Every semester the course materials and foci vary
depending on the needs and interests of students in the class.
456. Accelerated Hindi. (C) Pien.
This is a fast paced course for learners who have some degree of listening and speaking skills in
Hindi, but have minimal or no literacy skills. In the Fall semester students acquire basic reading and
writing skills and advance their speaking and listening skills to be able to communicate on everyday
personal and social topics in Hindi. Grammatical accuracy and sociocultural appropriateness are
emphasized throughout the course. In the Spring semester, students continue to advance all the
linguistic skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing) and functions (narration, description,
supporting opinion) with a special focus on reading and writing. Students develop formal vocabulary
through authentic oral and written input rich in content and culture.

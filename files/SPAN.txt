SM 223. Introduction to Literary Analysis. (C) Arts & Letters Sector. All Classes.Prerequisite(s):
Spanish 202 or Spanish 212.
Literature from Spain and Latin America contains a wealth of information about language, history, and
culture. The goal of this course is to help students develop skills to carefully read Spanish literary
works while preparing them for upper-level courses and study abroad. We begin reviewing the main
characteristics of various literary movements and of the four genres (narrative, poetry, theater and
essay). During the second part of the semester, students become familiarized with a wide variety of
theoretical approaches to the study of literature with the purpose of applying them to their own
analytical writing. In the last part of the course students produce their own essays on a text chosen by
them and based on research. Sample essays written by other students and included in the textbook
will serve as models. Throughout the course students will have ample opportunities to hone their skills
through the close reading and class discussion of varied and stimulating works by Miguel de
Cervantes, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Roberto Bolano, etc.

SM 698. Workshop on Scholarly Writing. (M)
This course aims to develop awareness about what constitutes effective scholarly prose in Spanish. It
proposes to hone the student's handling of writing as a vehicle for the expression of intellectual
thought, but also to develop a consciousness of the rhetorical strategies that can be used to advance
a critical argument effectively. Extensive writing exercises will be assigned; these will be followed by
intense and multiple redactions of the work originally produced. The ulitmate goal is to make students
develop precision, correctness, and elegance in written Spanish. Students will also work on a class
paper written previously, with a view to learning the process of transforming a short, limited
expression of an argument into a publishable article.

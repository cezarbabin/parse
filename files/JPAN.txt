481. Advanced Japanese for Proficiency I. (A) Staff.Prerequisite(s): Completion of the JPAN 312
or 382 or the equivalent. Offered through Penn Language Center.
This course is for students with an advanced background in Japanese, who are interested in taking
at least the Level 2 Japanese Proficiency Test. Solid grammar, an extensive vocabulary, and the
knowledge of at least 800-900 Chinese characters is required. This course is not continuous with
any existing 300-level Japanese course; therefore, your grade from a 300-level course does not
qualify you to take this course. Eligibility will be determined through an interview and placement test
taken in the first meeting. All students who take this course are required to take the Japanese
Proficiency Test in December.
Since the JLPT is administered in December every year, if you wish to fully prepare for the test,
the instructor strongly recommends that you take JPAN 482 first in the spring of the same year. For
example, if you plan to take the test in December, 2010, start taking 482 in the spring 2010 and
take 481 in the fall 2010. Different from other courses, this full-year course begins in the spring and
ends in the fall, because the test is given in December. However, participation in 482 is optional.
482. Advanced Japanese for Proficiency II. (B) Staff.Prerequisite(s): Japanese proficiency test
and permission of instructor. Offered through the Penn Language Center.
This course is for students with an advanced-low or advanced-mid background in Japanese, aiming

understanding of Japanese culture. The class will use authentic Japanese through media, such as
newspapers, television, and articles, regarding Japanese culture and society as well as current
news. Students will narrate, describe, and express their opinions with details, examples, and strong
reasoning, using sophisticated terms and phrases related such topics.

575. (JWST457) Aramaic: Approahes to Talmud: Traditional and Academic. (A) Staff.Prerequisite
(s): Prior experience studying the Babylonian Talmud in the original.
Course will examine several key legal passages (sugyot) in the Babylonian Talmud from both a
traditional and an academic perspective. After identifying important tensions and inconsistencies in
each text, we will consider the disparate solutions posed by the early medieval rabbis (Rishonim) and
contemporary scholars, and compare their respective approaches. Through these in-depth readings
we will highlight how modern assumptions and goals for Talmud study differ from earlier generations
and how contemporary approaches allow us to uncover new structures and meanings in the text.
Attention will be paid to the comprehension of Aramaic lexical and grammatical forms. Open to
students with prior experience studying the Babylonian Talmud in the original.

646. The Land of Sumer: Writing, Language, and Culture. (M) Tinney.
This self-contained course sets the Sumerian language, writing system and use of writing in their
social and historical context. The aim is to provide students of ancient history and culture from diverse
disciplines with a good grounding in Sumerian culture, familiarity with the Sumerian language and
cuneiform writing system and the requisite knowledge for critical assessment of published translations
and of the secondary literature. The course is organized as two threads, culture on the one hand and
language on the other. The two threads are united by taking examples in the language exercises,
vocabulary assignments, etc., as far as possible from the domain of the week' cultural topics. The net
effect is to examine the culture both through contemporary secondary literature and through direct
contact with elementary primary texts of relevance to the various topics of discussion. The language
component of the course will be carried out in a combination of transliteration and cuneiform, with an
expectation that all students will gain familiarity with at least the core 80 syllabic signs, and about 100
additional logographic signs.

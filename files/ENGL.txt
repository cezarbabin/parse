SM 016. (AFRC017, ARTH100, CINE016, COML016, URBS106) Topics in Literature. (C) Freshman
Seminar
Freshman Seminars under the title "Topics in Literature" will afford entering students who are
considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with
a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of
Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all
students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and
extensive writing assignments, but these seminars are not writing courses; rather, they are intensive
introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major
and may be applied to a period, genre, or thematic requirement within the major.

SM 001. (COML001) Approaches to Genre. (C)
Usually housed in the Program for Comparative Literature, this seminar engages questions of literary
genre, including its function as a mediating presence for thinking about audience, literary history, and
the marketplace. The theme of the seminar will chnage with the instructor. Customarily this course will
be affiliated with Communication within the Curriculum (CWIC), and so will have a speaking and
presentation component to it.
SM 002. (COML002) Approaches to Literary Studies. (C)
Usually housed in the program for Comparative Literature, this seminar engages questions of method
and interdisciplinarity. It will therefore cover not only a range of approaches to literary texts, but also
explore how the methodologies of other disciplines migth be brought efficaciously to bear on the
objects of literary study. The theme of the seminar will change with the instructor. Customarily this
course will be affiliated with Communication within the Curriculum (CWIC), and so will have a speaking
and presentation component to it.

018. Old English. (M)
This course introduces students to the powerful and influential corpus of Old English literature. We will
read a wide variety of texts: short poems such as The Wonderer, The Seafarer, The Wife's Lament and
the passionate religious poem The Dream of The Rood; chronicles such as The Battle Of Maldon
Against The Vikings, The Old Testament, Exodus and Bede's Conversion Of The English; and
selections from the greatest of all English epics, Beowulf. Readings will be in Old English, and the first
few weeks of the course will be devoted to mastering Old English prosody, vocabulary, and grammar
(as well as a crash course on the early history of the English language). During the last few weeks we
may read modern criticism of Old English poetry, or we will consider the modern poetic reception of
Old English literature and explore theories and problems of translation, reading translations of Old
English poems by Yeats, Auden, Tolkien, and Heaney.

SM 020. Literature Before 1660. (C)
This course will introduce students to key works of English literature written before 1660. It will explore
the major literary genres of this period, as well as the social and cultural contexts in which they were
produced. The course will examine how literature texts articulate changes in language and form, as
well as in concepts of family, nation, and community during the medieval and early modern periods.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current
offerings.
SM 021. (COML021) Medieval Literature and Culture. (M)
This course introduces students to four hundred years of English literary culture, from approximately
1100 to 1500. This period was marked by major transformations, not only with respect to government,
law, religious practice, intellectual life, England's relation to the Continent (during the 100 Years War),
the organization of society (especially after the Black Death), the circulation of literary texts, and the
status of authors. Topics may include medieval women writers, manuscript production, literatures of
revolt, courtly culture, Crusades, cross-Channel influences, and religious controversy.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current

022. Romance. (M)
This course will focus on what is arguably the most extravagant, adventuresome, and fantastical of the
literary genres: the Romance. We will read a number of medieval and renaissance romance narratives,
in verse and prose, beginning with the Arthurian romances (Malory's Morte D'Arthur, Sir Gawain And
The Green Knight) and continuing with as many (and as much) of the great renaissance romances as
time will allow: Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queen, and Lady Mary
Wroth's Urania.

024. (CINE024, COMM204) Introduction to American and British Film and Media. (M)
This is a course on the history of Hollywood. It seeks to unravel Hollywood's complex workings and
explain how the business and politics of the film industry translate into the art of film. We will trace the
American film industry from Edison to the internet, asking questions such as: What is the relationship
between Hollywood and independent film? How has the global spread of Hollywood since the 1920s
changed the film industry? How has Hollywood responded to crises in American politics (e.g., world
wars, the cold war, terrorism)? And how have new technologies such as synchronized sound and color
cinematography, television and the VCR, and new digital technologies changed film and the film
industry? We will look closely at representative studios (Paramount, Disney, and others),
representative filmmakers (Mary Pickford, Frank Capra, and George Lucas, amoung many others),
and we will examine the impact of industrial changes on the screen.
025. The Age of Chaucer. (M)
In this class we come to speak as people spoke in England some six centuries ago: in medieval or
'Middle' English. We do this by reading the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer, a great poet who has
influenced everyone from William Shakespeare to Sylvia Plath. Since Middle English takes some
getting use to, class assignments are not heavy: usually about 800 lines per class. A typical class
might begin by looking at a few of the easier passages in the Canterbury Tales, proceed to reading the
greatest poem of love in the English language (Chaucer's Troilus And Criseyde), before moving on to
other contemporary writers in medieval culture. We will likely compare representations of medieval
Christianty, Judaism, and Islam, as well as aspects of film adaptation by Italian filmmaker Pasolini (and
perhaps by Chaucer scholar Terry Jones). We will consider what it might have been like to live secure
in an age of faith; yet to live insecure, as a dizzying new profusion of trades and occupations sprang
up in unprecedented "divisions of labor." We will imagine being a medieval woman, and may visit and
handle medieval manuscripts. Above all, we will enjoy the poetry.

026. (THAR101) Early Drama. (M)
Early drama in English had its roots as much in Christianity as in Classical antiquity. What grew into
the theater of Shakespeare began as networks of strolling players and church atuhorities in market
towns sponsoring cycles of "miracle" and "mystery" plays. This course will introduce students to major
dramatic works of the medieval and early modern periods, including plays written for the public stage,
closet dramas, masques, mayoral pageants and other kinds of performances. The course will also pay
attention to the development of different dramatic genres during these periods, as well as the social
and cultural contexts in which they were produced. Students thus will explore the history of drama in
English through the renaissance to the closing of the theaters in 1641 and their eventual reopening in
1660.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current
offerings.
033. (RELS015) The Bible As Literature. (M)
Successive generations have found the Bible to be a text which requires - even demands - extensive
interpretation. This course explores the Bible as literature, considering such matters as the artistic
arrangement and stylistic qualities of individual episodes as well as the larger thematic patterns of
both the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha. A good part of the course is spent looking at
the place of the Bible in cultural and literary history and the influence of such biblical figures as Adam
and Eve, David, and Susanna on writers of poetry, drama, and fiction in the English and American
literary traditions.

029. (CLST102, COML167) Classical Antiquity and English Literature. (M) Arts & Letters Sector.
All Classes. [Formerly ENGL 096]
This course will examine the relationship between English literature and that of ancient Greece and
Rome. At times we will discuss how classical theories of genre and aesthetics were appropriate and
reinvented in medieval, renaissance, and seventeenth-century texts. What does it mean to call Hamlet
and Oedipus The King tragedies, or The Frogs and The Way Of The World comedies? Should we
consider the development of English drama and poetry as an extension of an imposing classcial
traditon or as a sustained and resistant response to it?

031. (COML031) Introduction to Renaissance Literature and Culture. (M) [Formerly ENGL 030]
This course will survey the cultural history of sixteenth and seventeenth century England.
Interdisciplinary in nature and drawing on the latest methodologies and insights of English studies, we
will explore how aesthetics, politics, social traditions, impacted literature at this vital and turbulent time
of English history.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current

032. Renaissance Poetics. (M)
An introduction to the theory and practice of verse in England from approximately 1500 to 1700.
Primarily concerned with poems by Skelton, Wyatt, Surrey, Gascoigne, Sidney, Shakespeare, Spenser,
Jonson, Donne, Herbert, Herrick, Marvel, and Milton, this course places special emphasis on the
influence of classical and continental poetry in Renaissance England, reading English texts
comparatively with texts by Horace, Ovid, Virgil, Petrarch, and du Bellay. The course also examines
contemporary critical writing about poetics; debates about the fitness of English to sustain a literture;
early efforts to invent a canon of English poets; the issue of translation; and the organization and
status of pre-modern genres, like pastoral, epigram and elegy.

034. (CINE138, FNAR034, HIST034) Cultures of The Book. (M) Humanities & Social Science Sector.
Class of 2010 & beyond. [Formerly ENGL 071]
The impact of various technologies (from writing to various forms of manuscript to print to electronics)
on the way the written word gives shape to a culture. The emphasis is on western cultures from Plato
to the present, but participation by students with interest or expertise in non-western cultures will be of
great value to the group as a whole. The course offers an ideal perspective from which students can
consider meta-issues surrounding their own special interests in a wide variety of fields, as well as
learn to think about the way in which traditional fields of study are linked by common inherited cultural
practices and constructions.

038. The Age of Milton. (M)
The seventeenth century was a time of revolution and upheaval, of excesses both puritanical and
cavalier. It saw the execution of one kind and the restoration of another, and survived the English Civil
War and the Great Fire and Great Plague of London. This course explores the literature of this century
through the works of John Milton's major works (selected sonnets, Comus, Areopagitica, Paradise
Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes), and his contemporaries. We will concentrate on a
number of issues that governed writing in the period, particularly the tension between individual
interiority and historial, social and political activity.

SM 040. British Poetry 1660 - 1914. (C)
This course provides students with a survey of British poetry and poetics from the Restoration to the
Modern period, and usually will include writers ranging from Aphra Behn and Alexander Pople to
Thomas Hardy. The course may be offered in various forms, some covering less, and some more
historical back ground. Most will provide a sampling of eighteenth-century, Romantic, and Victorian
poets.

041. 18th-Century British Literature. (M)
An introduction to British literary and cultural history in the eighteenth century. Typically, this course will
contain materials from the later seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries--from the Restoration
and Glorious Revolution through the Englightenment, the American and French Revolutions, and the
Napoloeonic Wars--though it need not cover the entire period. We will read plays, poetry and prose in
order to understand the aesthetic, intellectual, social and political issues of literary production and
achievement in this period.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current

050. The Romantic Period. (M)
This course offers an introduction to the literature of the Romantic period (ca. 1770-1830). Some
versions of this course will incorporate European romantic writers, while others will focus exclusively
on Anglo-American romanticism, and survey authors such as Austen, Blake, Brockden Brown, Byron,
Coleridge, Emerson, Irving, Keats, Radcliffe, Scott, Shelley, and Wordsworth.

045. (GSWS045) 18th-Century Novel. (M)
This survey of the novel addresses key questions about the novel's "rise" in the eighteenth century on
both sides of the Atlantic, as well as attending to the cultural conditions that attended this new literary
from. How did the concurrent "rise" of the middle classes and the emergence of an increasingly female
reading public affect the form and preoccupations of early novels? What role did institutions like literary
reviews, libraries, and the church play in the novel's early reception? While reading will vary from
course to course, students should expect to read such authors as Austen, Behn, Brockden Brown,
Burney, Defoe, Fielding, Richardson, Rowlandson, Rowson, Scott, and Smollett.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current

046. Drama from 1660 - 1840. (M)
This course surveys drama from the Restoration through the Romantic period, and in so doing
explores arguably the most tumultuous period of British and American Theater history. These years
saw the reopening of the theaters in London in 1660 after their having been closed through two
decades of Civil War and Puritan rule. They witnessed the introduction of actresses to the stage, the
development of scenery and the modern drop-apron stage, the establishment of theatrical monopolies
in 1660 and stringent censorship in 1737, and the gradual introduction, acceptance, and eventual
celebration of the stage in America. Perhaps most importantly, they oversaw some of the best
comedies and farces in the English language, the introduction of pantomime and the two-show
evening, sustained experimentation with music and spectacle on stage, and the transformation of
tragedy into a star vehicle for actors and actresses like David Garrick, Sarah Siddons, John Philip
Kemble, and Edmund Kean.

051. (CINE051, GSWS051) 19th-Century British Literature. (M)
In 1815 in the wake of the battle of Waterloo, Great Britain controlled a staggering quarter of the
world's landmass and half of its gross national product. This course will begin with the Napoleonic
Wars and this Regency aftermath to survey a century of British literature -- from Romanticism through
the revolutions of 1848 and the Victorian and Edwardian periods to the beginning of the first World
War. Most versions of this course will read both novels and poetry, often focusing on the relation
between the two and their function within nineteenth century culture. Others may incorporate drama
and non-fiction prose.

053. 19th-Century American Literature. (M) [Formerly ENGL 083]
A consideration of outstanding literary treatments of American culture from the early Federalist period
to the beginnings of the First World War. We will traverse literary genres, reading autobiographies and
travel accounts as well as fiction and poetry.

054. (AFRC054, COML054, MUSC054) Sounding Poetry: Music and Literature. (A) Arts & Letters
Sector. All Classes.
Never before has poetry been so inescapable. Hip hop, the soundtrack of our times, has made rhyme,
meter, and word-play part of our daily lives. How did this happen? This course begins not on the page,
but in the bardic traditions of Homer's Iliad, which encoded many of the values of its time in oral
formulas. Poetry was, however, no mere encyclopedia, but also a source of risk, as we will read in
Plato's warning against its hypnotic powers, and in the excesses of the Bacchae. We continue through
19th and 20th century attempts to recover these classic traditions (Wordsworth, Longfellow, Pound).
Yet Europe was not the only center of poetic production. How does the Homeric tradition relate to living
traditions of West African singing poets (griots) and Southern African praise songs? And what traces
of these traditions can we hear in the blues? We will listen to early blues recordings and discuss the
politics of collecting folklore, and the genius of African American modernists (Langston Hughes,
Claude McKay, Georgia Douglas Johnson) who bought vernacular speech onto the page. We will read
and listen to a number of 20th century poets inspired when page meets stage in jazz poetry, dub
poetry, spoken word, and hip hop. Assignments will include 2 papers, 2 small-group performances,
memorization exercises, and a creative adaptation of one poem.
057. (AFRC057, LALS057) Literature of the Americas to 1900. (M) [Formerly ENGL 080]
This course examines U.S. literature and culture in the context of the global history of the Americas.
Historical moments informing the course will range from the origins of the Caribbean slave-and-sugar
trade at the beginning of the nineteenth century, to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 and the U.S. Mexico
and Spanish-American wars. Readings will include works by authors such as Frances Caldern de la
Barca, Frederick Douglass, Helen Hunt Jackson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Jose Marti, Herman
Melville, John Rollin Ridge, Mara Amparo Ruiz de Burton, and Felix Varela.

055. (COML055, GSWS055) 19th-Century Novel. (M)
During the nineteenth century the novel became the dominant literary form of its day, supplanting
poetry and drama on both sides of the Atlantic. In this introduction to the novelists of the period, we will
read the writers who secured the novel's cultural respectability and economic prominence. Likely
authors will include Austen, the Brontes, Collins, Dickens, Eliot, Hardy, Hawthorne, Melville, Poe,
Thackeray, Scott, and Stowe. The course will explore the themes, techniques, and styles of the
nineteeth-century novel. It will focus not only on the large structural and thematic patterns and
problems within each novel but also on the act of reading as a historically specific cultural ritual in
itself.
See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current

056. (THAR125) Modern Drama. (M)
This course will explore the major dramatic and theatrical movements that constitute the "modern,"
from the successive rises of melodrama and "realism" in the nineteenth century, to those theatrical
aesthetics that positioned themselves beyond or against realism at the turn of the twentieth century, to
the present day. We'll explore political theatre, the invention of the avant garde, the rise of the auteurdirector, performance art, feminist and queer theatres, and the integration of non-western theatre into
shared theatre practice in the colonial and post-colonial world.

058. Irish Literature. (M) [Formerly ENGL 063]
This course will provide an introduction to modern Irish literature, focusing on the tension between
Ireland's violent history and its heroic mythology. This tension leaves its mark not only on the ravaged
landscape, but also on the English language, which displays its "foreignness" most strongly in the
hands of Irish writers. Readings will span the genres of poetry, drama, fiction, and history, and will
include works by Sommerville and Ross, Yeats, George Moore, Joyce, Synge, O'Casey, Beckett, Edna
O'Brien, and Brian Friel.

059. (COML059) Modernisms and Modernities. (M)
This class explores the international emergence of modernism, typically from the middle of the 19th
century to the middle of the 20th century. We will examine the links between modernity, the avantgarde, and various national modernisms that emerged alongside them. Resolutely transatlantic and
open to French, Spanish, Italian, German, or Russian influences, this course assumes the very
concept of Modernism to necessitate an international perspective focusing on the new in literature and
the arts -- including film, the theatre, music, and the visual arts. The philosophies of modernism will
also be surveyed and concise introductions provided to important thinkers like Marx, Nietzsche, Sorel,
Bergson, Freud, and Benjamin.

060. Rise of the Novel. (M)
This course explores the history of the British novel and the diverse strategie of style, structure,
characterization, and narrative techniques it has deployed since the late seventeenth century. While
works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries will form the core of the reading, some versions of
this course will include twentieth-century works. All will provide students with the opportunity to test the
advantages and limitations of a variety of critical approaches to the novel as a genre. Readings may
include works by Behn, Swift, Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Lennox, Smollett, Burney, Scott, Austen,
the Brontes, Dickens, Eliot, Hardy, Conrad, Joyce, Lawrence, Woolf, Rhys, Greene, Naipaul, Carter,
Rushdie, and Coetzee.

of fiction, poetry, plays, and essays, and will consider aesthetic movements such as modernism as
well as historical contexts including the two World Wars, the decline of empire, and racial and sexual
conflict. Authors treated might include: Conrad, Yeats, Joyce, Eliot, Lawrence, Forster, Shaw, Woolf,
Auden, Orwell, Beckett, Achebe, Rhys, Synge, Naipaul, Rushdie, Heaney, and Walcott.

069. (AFRC069, COML069) Poetry and Poetics. (M)
What is poetry and what place does it have among literary forms? What is its relation to culture,
history, and our sense of speakers and audiences? This course will focus on various problems in
poetic practice and theory, ranging from ancient theories of poetry of Plato and Aristotle to
contemporary problems in poetics. In some semesters a particular school of poets may be the focus;
in others a historical issue of literary transmission, or a problem of poetic genres, such as lyric,
narrative, and dramatic poetry, may be emphasized. The course will provide a basic knowledge of
scansion in English with some sense of the historical development of metrics. This course is a good
foundation for those who want to continue to study poetry in literary history and for creative writers
concentrating on poetry.

062. (COML062) 20th-Century Poetry. (M)
From abstraction to beat, from socialism to negritude, from expressionism to ecopoetry, from
surrealism to visual poetry, from collage to digital poetry, the poetry of the twentieth century has been
characterized by both the varieties of its forms and the range of its practitioners. This course will offer a
broad overview of many of the major trends and a few minor eddies in the immensely rich, wonderfully
varied, ideologically and aesthetically charged field. The course will cover many of the radical poetry
movements and individual innovations, along with the more conventional and idiosyncratic work, and
will provide examples of political, social, ethnic, and national poetries, both in the Americas and
Europe, and beyond to the rest of the world. While most of the poetry covered will be in English, works
in translation, and indeed the art of translation, will be an essential component the course.

080. (AFRC079, MUSC080) Literatures of Jazz. (M)
That modernism is steeped as much in the rituals of race as of innovation is most evident in the
emergence of the music we have come to know as jazz, which results from collaborations and
confrontations taking place both across and within the color line. In this course we will look at jazz and
the literary representations it engendered in order to understand modern American culture. We will
explore a dizzying variety of forms, including autobiography and album liner notes, biography, poetry,
fiction, and cinema. We'll examine how race, gender, and class influenced the development of jazz
music, and then will use jazz music to develop critical approaches to literary form. Students are not
required to have a critical understanding of music. Class will involve visits from musicians and critics,
as well as field trips to some of Philadelphias most vibrant jazz venues.

This course is an introduction to the history of cinema from the 1890s to the present. In demonstrating
how history energizes and complicates the movies, we will examine numerous film cultures and
historical periods, including Hollywood silent cinema, Italian neo-realism, the French New Wave,
recent films from Iran, and a variety of other film movements from different historical epochs and
cultures. Screenings will feature movies such as Sergei Eisenstein's THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN
(1925), Jean Renoir's THE GRAND ILLUSION (1937), Nicholas Ray's REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE
(1955), Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963), Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING (1989), Sally
Potter's ORLANDO (1992), and Pedro Almodovar's TALK TO HER (2003). Our aim is to establish a
broad historical and global foundation for the understanding of film as a complex exchange between
art, technology, politics, and economics. Screenings will be mandatory.

This course is an introduction to the analysis of film as both a textual practice and a cultural practice.
We will examine a variety of films--from Fritz Lang's M (1931) to Julia Dash's DAUGHTERS OF THE
DUST (1991)--in order to demonstrate the tools and skills of "close reading." We will concentrate on
those specifically filmic features of the movies, such as mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing and
sound strategies, as well as those larger organizational forms, such as narrative and non-narrative
structures and movie genres. Because our responses to the movies always extend beyond the film
frame, we will additionally look closely at the complex business of film distribution, promotion, and
exhibition to show how the less visible machinery of the movie business also shapes our
understanding and enjoyment of particular films. Along the way, we will discuss some of the most
influential and productive critical schools of thought informing film analysis today, including realism,
auteurism, feminism, postmodernism, and others. Screenings are mandatory.

Classes. This course is intended to serve as a foundation for students interested in going on to
become English majors.
Literature does not exist for your protection. So dangerous is it, that Socrates argued poets ought to be
banned from his ideal Republic. And Socrates himself--one of the most subversive of all poetic
thinkers--was condemned to death for corrupting the young with his speeches. All great literature is
unsettling and alarming. Along with its beauty and delicacy and rhetorical power and ethical force, it
can be terrifyingly sublime and even downright ugly: full of contempt and horror and grandiosity and
malice. From Socrates' day to our own, countless writers have been jailed, exiled, and murdered, their
works censored, banned, burned, for daring to say what others wish would remain unsaid--about
religion and the State; sexuality, gender, and the body; art, science, and commerce; freedom and
order; love and hate--and for saying it in ways that are aesthetically innovative, surprising, seductive,
ravishingly unanticipated.
This course will introduce you to fundamentals of literary style, form, and history, and to approaches
to reading and interpretation. It will also mean paying close attention to your own writing, in a series of
brief essays and blog contributions in which you'll learn better how to meet the demands of collegelevel writing while striving always to be a dangerous writer yourself.

This course examines theatre and performance in the context of the border urban, artistic and political
cultures housing them from the Renaissance to the mid-19th century. Encompassing multiple cultures
and traditions, it will draw on a variety of readings and viewings designed to locate the play, playwright,
trend or concept under discussion within a specific socio-historical context. The evolution of written
and performed drama, theatre architecture, and scenography will be examined in tandem with the
evolution of various nationalisms, population shifts, and other commerical and material forces on
theatrical entertainment. Readings consequently will be drawn not only from plays and other
contemporary documents, but also from selected works on the history, theory, design technology, art,
politics or society of the period under discussion.

SM 111. (COML115) Experiential Writing Seminar. (C)
We spend our lives in front of screens, mostly wasting time: checking social media, watching cat
videos, chatting, and shopping. What if these activities clicking, SMSing, status-updating, and random
surfing were used as raw material for creating compelling and emotional works of literature? Could we
reconstruct our autobiography using only Facebook? Could we write a great novella by plundering our
Twitter feed? Could we reframe the internet as the greatest poem ever written? Using our laptops and
a wifi connection as our only materials, this class will focus on the alchemical recuperation of aimless
surfing into substantial works of literature. Students will be required to stare at the screen for three
hours, only interacting through chat rooms, bots, social media and listservs. To bolster our practice,
we'll explore the long history of the recuperation of boredom and time-wasting through critical texts
about affect theory, ASMR, situationism and everyday life by thinkers such as Guy Debord, Mary Kelly
Erving Goffman, Betty Friedan, Raymond Williams, John Cage, Georges Perec, Michel de Certeau,
Henri Lefevbre, Trin Minh-ha, Stuart Hall, Sianne Ngai, Siegfried Kracauer and others. Distraction,

SM 120. (COML121) Working with Translations. (M) This course is not open to freshman.
Permission of instructor required.
In this class we will study and translate some of the major figures in 20th century poetry, including
Rainer Maria Rilke, Claire Malroux, Pablo Neruda, Cesare Pavese, Anna Akhmatova, and Bei Dao.
While the curriculum will be tailored to the interests and linguistic backgrounds of the students who
enroll, all those curious about world poetry and the formidable, irresistible act of translation are
welcome. Students should have at least an intermediate knowledge of a language other than English.
We will study mulitple translations of seminal poems, render our own versions in response, and have
the additional opportunity to work directly from the original. Students may also work in pairs, or groups.
A portion of the course will be set up as a creative writing workshop in which to examine the overall
effect of each others' translations so that first drafts can become sucessful revisions. While class
discussions will explore the contexts and particularity of (among others) Urdu, Italian, French, and
Polish poetry, they might ultimately reveal how notions of national literature have radically shifted in
recent years to more polyglottic and globally textured forms. Through guest speakers, essays on
translation theory, and our own ongoing experiments, this course will celebrate the ways in which great
poetry underscores the fact that language
itself is a translation. In addition to the creative work, assignments will include an oral presentation,
informal response papers, and a short final essay.
SM 116. (CINE116) Screenwriting Workshop. (C) Students wishing to take this course must submit

classic screenplay texts will be critically analyzed (REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, DOCTOR
STRANGELOVE, PSYCHO, etc.) Students will then embark on writing their own scripts. We will
intensively focus on: character enhancement, creating "believable" cinematic dialogue, plot
development and story structure, conflict, pacing, dramatic foreshadowing, the element of surprise,
text and subtext and visual story-telling. Class attendance is mandatory. Students will submit their
works-in-progress to the workshop for discussion.

SM 117. The Arts and Popular Culture. (C)
This is a workshop-oriented course that will concentrate on all aspects of writing about artistic
endeavor, including criticism, reviews, profiles, interviews and essays. For the purposes of this class,
the arts will be interpreted broadly, and students will be able -- and, in fact, encouraged -- to write
about both the fine arts and popular culture. Students will be doing a great deal of writing throughout
the course, but the main focus will be a 3000-word piece about an artist or arts organization in
Philadelphia (or another location approved by the instructor) that will involve extensive reporting,
interviews and research. Potential subjects can range from a local band to a museum, from a theater
group to a comedian.

to be considered are writing as a public act, issues of taste and of privacy, questions of ethics and of
policy, methods of research and of checking, excerpting, marketing, and the realistic understanding of
assignments and of the publishing world. Student papers will be the basis of weekly editorial sessions,
with concentration on the language: how to render material literate, how to recognize and dispose of
padding and self-indulgence, how to tighten structure and amplify substance.

SM 155. Writing in the Documentary Tradition. (C) Candidates for this course are required to
submit as soon as possible their best example of nonfiction prose. A brief interview with the instructor
is required before a permission to enroll can be granted. This course is not open to freshmen.
This course will function as a workshop, with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor
the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over
time. Here, it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with
one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format
and structure. In English 155, a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's highschool basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the
graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a clientpatient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary
and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's
end, each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of

SM 156. Photographs and Stories. (C) Please send at your convenience a writing sample(s) to Paul
Hendrickson at: phendric@english.upenn.edu.
A new creative writing course built entirely around the use of photographs, and the crafting of
compelling nonfiction narratives from them. The essential concept will be to employ photographs as
storytelling vehicles. So we will be using curling, drugstore printed Kodak shots from our own family
albums. We will be using searing and famous images from history books. We will be taking things from
yesterday's newspaper. We will even be using pictures that were just made by the workshop
participants outside the campus gates with a disposable camera from CVS or with their own
sophisticated digital Nikon. In all of this, there will be one overriding aim to achieve memorable, fullbodied stories. To locate the strange, evocative, storytelling universes that are sealed inside the four
rectangular walls of photograph. They are always there, if you know how to look. It's about the quality
of your noticing, the intensity of your seeing.

SM 159. Political Writing in the Digital Age: The 2014 MidTerm Elections. (C) May be repeated for
credit with a different instructor.
A primer on writing about U.S. politics, in an era of major technological upheaval and serious voter
polarization. Today's 24/7, wi-fi'd, blogging environment-along with the rise of new conservative media
are changing the ways that writers cover politics and deliver the information.

SM 160. Reading & Writing In The "New Journalism". (C) Staff. Please send at your convenience a
writing sample(s) to Paul Hendrickson at: phendric@english.upenn.edu.
This course will focus on the most revolutionary period in contemporary journalism - the 1960s, when
writers such as Tom Wolfe, Michael Herr, Gay Talese, Anthony Lukas, Norman Mailer, and Thomas B.
Morgan vastly expanded the possibilities of non-fiction. Dubbed "the new journalism," its practitioners
adapted certain aspects of the novel (scenes, dialogue, structure) in order to better tell true-life stories.
Students in this course will read extensively, to understand how these breakthrough writers have
profoundly influenced the long-form journalism of today. A book about the New Journalism, "The Gang
That Couldn't Write Straight," will be used as a reference. Each student will also write a long-form
journalistic piece, using many elements of the form.

SM 161. The Art of the Profile. (C) The course is not open to freshmen.
One of the toughest challenges for any journalist is to master the art of the profile-writing. In this new
course, students will read and critique some of the classic profile articles of the past 40 years, and,
most importantly, write profile articles of their own. Writing about people is often very rewarding, but
rarely easy. In this course, students will debate the questions that have plagued and energized
journalists for generations: How do you persuade somebody that he or she is a worthy topic for a
profile? How do you ask sensitive questions? If the person is a celebrity, how do you avoid being
manipulated into writing a "puff piece"? Do you tape the interviews or just take notes? How do you
structure a profile in order to keep the reader's attention? Is it even possible to capture the essence of
a person on the written page? Are you a friend to the profile subject--or a manipulator? A journalist at
The New Yorker recently said that a writer's relationship with the profile subject is "a kind of love affair."
On the other hand, a famous author once said that a profile writer is typically "gaining their trust and
betraying without remorse." Which is closer to the truth?
Students, in addition to writing their own profiles, will kick around these questions while reading
some of the best contemporary profile writers, including Susan Orlean, Gay Talese, David Remnick,
Mark Bowden, and Judy Bachrach. The instructor will also offer several of his own.

SM 162. Covering Political Elections. (C) This course is not open to freshman.
In this new course, students with a passion for both writing and politics will have the unique
opportunity to track the news as it unfolds week by week, to critique it in class, and, most importantly,
to write about it in a variety of formats, ranging from "straight" news to informed opinion. Students can
expect spirited class debate about the elusive nature of "objectivity," the often thin line between truth
and rumor, the challenges of fact-checking a candidate's "spin," the challenges of writing responsibility
in an era when even facts seem to be polarized, the challenges of analyzing primary results and
writing about it effectively, the growing pressure on journalists to reveal their political beliefs, and much
more. Some of the writing will happen in class; students will view excerpts from debates and Sunday
shows, and file their reports "on deadline." Some of the class sessions will focus on the hottest news
of the moment. And students will also have a chance, in class, to critique some of the nation's best
political writers--reporters, feature writers, columnists, and bloggers.

SM 165. Writing through Culture and Art. (C) May be repeated for credit with a different instructor.

correspondent methods of responding to the ICA's exhibitions. The class will involve monthly trips to

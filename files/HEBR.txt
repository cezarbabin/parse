This course introduces students to the methods and resources used in the modern study of the Bible.
To the extent possible, these methods will be illustrated as they apply to a single book of the Hebrew
Bible that will serve as the main focus of the course.
The course is designed for undergraduates who have previously studied the Bible in Hebrew either
in high school or college. It presupposes fluency in reading and translating Bibical Hebrew and a
working knowledge of Biblical Hebrew grammar.
SM 258. (FOLK258, HEBR558, JWST258, RELS228) Studies in Medieval Jewish Literature. (C)
Fishman.Prerequisite(s): Reading knowledge of Hebrew.
This course will introduce students to the modern academic study of the different genres of medieval
Jewish literature-- poetry, narrative, interpretation of the Bible, liturgy, historiography, philosophy,
sermonic, mystical and pietistic writings. In addition to studying the primary texts, the course will also
explore the historical, religious, and cultural contexts in which these texts were first produced and
then studied, and the aspects of Jewish historical experience that these texts reflect. The specific
topic of the course (eg. Medieval Biblical Interpretation, Kabbalah) will vary from semester to
semester. In some cases, the specific topic may also be the work of a specific author, like
Maimonides. Primary sources will be read in their original Hebrew. While no previous experience in
studying these texts is required, students should be able to read unpointed Hebrew texts. If there is a
question as to whether the course is appropriate for you, please contact the professor.

Fall 2016: We will discuss literary works that reflect Israelis' struggle with their national identity. For the
patriotic 1948 generation, self and country were one and the same while contemporary writers ask
what it means to be Israeli. Yehuda Amichai's 1955 poem "I want to die in my bed" was a manifesto
for individualism, yet the seemingly interminable Arab-Israeli conflict forced writers to return to the
national, social, and political arenas starting in the 1980s, although in entirely different ways.
Readings include works by the contemporary Orly Kastel Bloom, Etgar Keret and Sayed Kashua as
well as by the early writers Natan Alterman, Amir Gilboa, Dahlia Ravikovitch, A.B. Yehoshua, and

SM 583. (COML527, HIST523, JWST523, RELS523) Studies in Medieval Jewish Culture. (A)
Fishman.Prerequisite(s): Unless otherwise noted, reading knowledge of Hebrew is required.
According to reigning historiography, the Jewish subcultures of Ashkenaz and Sefarad developed
differently because the former was the cultural heir of ancient Palestinian Jewry, while the latter was
the heir of Babylonian Jewry. Yet scholarship of the last several decades has shown the inadequacy of
this claim. This graduate level course will reconstruct some of the underlying problems with this claim
and suggest that examination of developments in the broader Roman, Christian and Islamic societies
offer alternate ways of accounting for the emergence of these Jewish subcultures in the Middle Ages.
Topics to be explored include cultural-geographic patterns following the collapse of the Roman
Empire; divergent approaches to Islamic law under the abbasid and Umayyad caliphates; genres of
legal composition in different parts of the Islamic world, and the status of aggadah (i.e., non-legal
rabbinic tradition) in medieval Ashkenaz and Sephardic traditions. Undergraduates may attend with
the instructor's permission.
